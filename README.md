[time.lapse.co](http://time.lapse.co)
=============

Create an awesome timelapse video with your webcam.

How it works
------------

time.lapse.co does it's work completely in your browser using all sorts of new HTML5 features.

Browser Support
---------------
Browsers need to support the getUserMedia API, webM as well as webP decoding and encoding for time.lapse.co to work.

*Supported*
*   Chrome 21+

*Currently Unsupported*
*   *Opera*. Supported getUserMedia [until version 12]{http://caniuse.com/stream} then lamely gave up on it in version 15. As soon as support returns I would expect Opera to be fully supported. Keeping my fingers crossed.
*   *Firefox*. Supports getUserMedia but not WebP. Can't do much until WebP is supported.
*   *Safari*. The new Internet Explorer, these slowpokes haven't begun to support getUserMedia or webp yet. This might take a while unfortunately.
